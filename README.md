# Advent of Code Restyle: Chrome Extension
This extension was originally developed because, in my opinion, the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website has a stylesheet that makes the site hard-to-read at best. While the main version of the extension overrides some components of the AoC stylesheet, this version only includes the additional functionality to private leaderboards&mdash;when hovering over a column in the leaderboard, the column expands to show the completion times of that day's challenge.

To install the extension, open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode, then drag and drop the `extension` folder.
