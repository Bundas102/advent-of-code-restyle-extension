# Advent of Code Restyle: Chrome Extension
The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website has a stylesheet that makes the site hard-to-read at best. This extension overrides some components of the AoC stylesheet to make the interface more pleasing to look at, while still attempting to preserve the original UI's general feel.

The extension also provides additioanl functionality to private leaderboards---when hovering over a column in the leaderboard, the column expands to show the completion times of that day's challenge.

To install the extension, open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), enable developer mode, then drag and drop the `extension` folder.
